This course introduces classical data structures and algorithms with emphasis on performance using asymptotic analysis of algorithms and complexity classes. The student will learn a variety of algorithms for searching, sorting, traversing and hashing. In addition, the course covers the application of these data structures and algorithms in real-life problems and implementing them in modern programming languages.
